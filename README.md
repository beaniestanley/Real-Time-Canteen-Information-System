# Real-Time-Canteen-Information-System

This project report is written to showcase the features of a Real-Time NTU Canteen Information System program built using Graphical User Interface (GUI) Programming in Python. This program is developed using the PyQt5 library, where parts of the GUI are generated using the in-built Qt Designer application, as well as additional program features developed using the qtawesome library. SQLite is used to store the database for the program.
